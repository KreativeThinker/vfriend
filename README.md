## Why VFriend?
An year ago, while I was a freshman at my college, I had an oddly specific problem of having a little too many friends. Oftentimes,  I’d often find myself digging through old WhatsApp/Discord chats, trying to find the timetables they had sent me, one by one, over and over. It was tedious, repetitive, and honestly, a little ridiculous. I kept thinking, there has to be a better way to do this. But back then, I didn’t know much about app development. I had spent time learning web dev, but even now, as I write this, you could say, this is my first real app.
